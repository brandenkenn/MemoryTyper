# MemoryTyper
A simple app for practicing memorization, recall, and touch typing at the same time

## Features
### Current features
- Lives in your browser. No login, security, or privacy issues here!
- Simple CRUD for *texts*&mdash;the units of text you want to memorize, such as verses, quotes, and paragraphs.
- Accuracy feedback while touch-typing/reciting: The screen is green when your keystrokes are right and red otherwise.

*Note:* Because all application data is stored in your browser, you could lose your data if your browser cache were to be cleared. Avail yourself of the import/export feature! (currently under development)

### Coming in 1.0.0 release

- Configurable handling of mistypes, punctuation, capitalization, whitespace, etc.
- Functional, minimal, and appealing design

### Coming in future releases
